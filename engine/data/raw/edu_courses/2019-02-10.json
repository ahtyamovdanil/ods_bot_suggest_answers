Этим летом наша лаборатория на Физтехе, iPavlov и лаборатория Text Machine Lab, University of Massachusetts Lowell проводят летнюю школу по разговорному ИИ.\n\n2nd INTERNATIONAL CONVERSATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SUMMER SCHOOL\nCISS 2019\nLowell, USA\nJune 24-29, 2019\n<http:\/\/ciss.deephack.me\/> [1]\nCo-organized by:\nText Machine Lab, University of Massachusetts Lowell\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning Lab, Moscow Institute of Physics and \nTechnology\n\n***************************************************************\nSCOPE:\nRecent advances in deep learning have sparked a renewed interest in dialogue systems in the research community. We are happy to announce the 2nd International Conversational Intelligence Summer School. The school  is planned as a one-week intensive program that includes (1) lecture instruction and programming tutorials, (2) invited lectures by guest speakers and (3) supervised project work. Instruction will include an introduction to the principles of deep neural networks application for natural language processing, including recurrent and convolutional networks, sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architectures with attention, as well as vector space lexical embeddings, and other advanced topics.  Participants will work in teams to build working prototypes for conversational agents, to be presented at the end of the school. Hosted by UMass Lowell, this summer school offers participants a chance to build solid understanding of core conversational AI concepts and techniques.\n\nAUDIENCE:\nThe intended audience of this summer school consists of 1st and 2nd year PhD and Masters’ students, advanced undergraduate students, and industry practitioners.  Required background: one semester of machine learning, with some exposure to neural network models, background in natural language processing is not required but desirable. Overall, CISS particularly encourages young researchers and students to apply. This is your chance get hands-on skills in conversation modelling and learn about state-of-the-art techniques in this exciting field.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nA one-week intensive program that includes instruction and programming tutorials in the morning, invited speaker colloquiums after lunch, followed by supervised project work in the late afternoon. See tentative schedule: <http:\/\/ciss.deephack.me> [2]\n\nVENUE:\nСISS 2019 will be held at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, Massachusetts, USA (located in the Greater Boston area).  UMass Lowell is a public research university and the second largest campus in the University of Massachusetts system, located 25 miles north of Boston on the picturesque Merrimack river.\n\nLOCATION:\nThe city of Lowell combines the natural beauty of scenic river banks with a rich history as a mill town and an early textile manufacturing center during the industrial revolution, with many of the 19th c. manufacturing sites preserved in the Lowell National Historical Park.  Lowell is easily accessible from both Logan International and Manchester Airports.\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKERS:\nJason Weston, Facebook AI Research\nAlexander Rush, Dept of Computer Science, Harvard University\nJoão Sedoc, Dept of Computer and Information Science, University of \nPennsylvania\nKate Saenko, Dept of Computer Science, Boston University\n\nORGANIZERS:\nMikhail Burtsev, Neural Networks and Deep Learning Lab, Moscow Institute of \nPhysics and Technology\nAnna Rumshisky, Text Machine Lab, Dept of Computer Science, University of \nMassachusetts Lowell\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\nFebruary 15, 2019 - Registration opens.\nFebruary 25, 2019 - Problems for the qualifying round released.\nMarch 25, 2019 - Solutions for the qualifying round due.\nApril 5, 2019 - Admission notification.\nApril 15, 2019 - Registration closes.\nJune 24-29, 2019 - Conversational Intelligence Summer School\n\nREGISTRATION:\n",
