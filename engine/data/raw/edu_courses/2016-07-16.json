                "text": "Microsoft wants more data scientists in the job market. But some young people need to acquire their knowledge starting completely anew, while&amp;nbsp;mid-career professionals need to build on their previous experience.\nTo plug the skills gap for both categories, Microsoft launched&amp;nbsp;a series of classes in data science through&amp;nbsp;edX.org,&amp;nbsp;the nonprofit online learning destination founded by Harvard University and MIT.\n\nThe Data Science Curriculum is the first offering of the Microsoft Professional Degree program, a Microsoft-led initiative to help professionals&amp;nbsp;grow their skills in critical fields. Launched today, the program&amp;nbsp;aims to offer an&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;employer-endorsed, university-caliber curriculum for professionals at any stage of their career,&amp;rdquo; the company said in a press release.\nData scientist is probably one of the most desired professions, with more job offerings than candidates.\nThe Microsoft course&amp;nbsp;consists of&amp;nbsp;nine classes and a final project. All classes can be audited for free. However, to receive credit toward the Microsoft Professional Degree, students must purchase a certificate for each of the 10 steps of the curriculum.\nThe certificate for the orientation class costs $25,&amp;nbsp;the verified certificate for &amp;ldquo;Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics&amp;rdquo; costs $99 and all other classes offer certificates for $49 each (the complete Data Science course costs $516).\nStudents need to enroll in specific course sessions. A calendar for each class is available here; prospective students can read the detailed syllabus, examine the elective options for each unit and enroll on the edX page of the class.&amp;nbsp;Each step requires a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 8 hours to be completed.\nMicrosoft is not the first major tech company to enter the field of IT online education &amp;mdash; Google and Udacity have partnered to offer&amp;nbsp;an Android nanodegree and other classes, and Amazon offers AWS training and certification for advance technical skills, including a big data class.",
